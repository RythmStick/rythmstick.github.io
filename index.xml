      <description>Introduction The modern threat landscape requires a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy, which often includes the interception and inspection of employee SSL-protected web traffic. As most attacks will now use some type of encryption, being able to log and inspect this content is vital.
Due to a lack of understanding of local privacy laws many organisations will whitelist certain categories of websites, such as finance/banking and health, presenting a blindspot to blue teams/incident responders and manifests itself in a lack of detailed logging.</description>

      <title>Hunting for malicious strings using AmsiTrigger</title>

      <description>Introduction I recently came across a situation where some offensive powershell tools which I’ve used quite often, are now eventually being flagged as malicious. In this case it was Windows Defender, although AMSI (AntiMalware Scan Interface) is agnostic of animalware product so it could easily be something different. In this situation, there’s a number of options available. I could use something like Invoke-Obfuscation to play around with functions/strings etc, I could do this manually using trial and error or I could use one of the AMSI bypasses that are available.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-1064 AppXSVC Local Privilege Escalation</title>

      <description>Intro Security researcher SandboxEscaper dropped a zero-day this week exploiting a race condition in the Windows AppX Deployment Service (AppXSVC). This was due to the service not handling hard links properly. Another zero-day (CVE-2019-0841) affecting the same service was previously fixed in April.
As Microsoft have now provided a fix for this in June&amp;rsquo;s Patch Tuesday updates, I&amp;rsquo;ve ported SandboxEscaper&amp;rsquo;s original PoC to C# (thanks to Rastamouse for C# hand holding).</description>

      <title>Lighting the path through EDRs using TikiTorch</title>

      <description>Intro A quick practical demonstration of using Rastamouse&amp;rsquo;s TikiTorch to bypass Endpoint protection, in this case a trial version of Sophos Intercept X (&amp;ldquo;Now with EDR&amp;rdquo;). For this demo we&amp;rsquo;ll be trying to run a 64 bit staged meterpreter reverse shell on a Windows 10 target.
Before we start, we&amp;rsquo;ll try to do it the old way to see how far we can get. Let&amp;rsquo;s generate a windows binary, download it using a browser and run it.</description>
